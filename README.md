# Excel-project DATA VISUALISATION/DATA STORYTELLING using Excel and Tableu
Aim: To analyze the Data of different Nations and getting trends in the form of visuals and maps using Tableu and Excel.
 I created a visual report that will show the data in the form of charts and maps using Tableau.

Requirement from the client:The client is colour blind and requested to bear this in mind when building dashboard that he is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. All my visuals are for the top 20 highest ranking countries.

The Data "Wealth of Nations" gives all information about different countries GDP,Life-expetency and Smartphone users details.
